# Keks Game Console

Keks is a 32-bit FPGA-based video game console and computer designed as a fun educational platform for teaching and learning about computers, electronics, FPGAs and programming.

This repo contains schematics, pinouts, firmware, gateware and documentation.

Additional examples will be added soon.

Find more information on the [Keks product page](https://machdyne.com/product/keks-game-console/).

## Blinky 

Building the blinky example requires [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys), [nextpnr-ice40](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr) and [IceStorm](https://github.com/YosysHQ/icestorm).

Assuming they are installed, you can simply type `make` to build the gateware, which will be written to output/blinky.bin. You can then connect the USB-C port to your computer and use the latest version of [ldprog](https://github.com/machdyne/ldprog) to write the gateware to the device.

## Programming

The RP2040 firmware and FPGA SRAM can be programmed over the USB-C port.

Configure the FPGA SRAM:

```
$ ldprog -k -s blinky.bin
```

It should also be possible to transfer gateware and games to the MicroSD card over the USB-C port but this is not yet implemented.

## Firmware

Keks ships with RP2040 [firmware](firmware) based on the [MÃ¼sli](https://github.com/machdyne/musli) firmware which allows it to communicate with [ldprog](https://github.com/machdyne/ldprog).

The firmware is responsible for initializing the system, [configuring and outputting the RP clock](https://raspberrypi.github.io/pico-sdk-doxygen/group__hardware__clocks.html#details), configuring the FPGA and detecting USB HID events.

The RP clock (CLK\_RP) is 126MHz by default. Keks also has a 100 MHz oscillator on board (CLK\_100).

*The following description is still under development and may change.*

*If an inserted FAT-formatted MicroSD card contains a bitstream file in the root directory named GATEWARE.BIN it will be used to configure the FPGA after power-on.*

*After FPGA configuration is complete the RP2040 firmware configures the RP2040 to act as an SPI slave on the CSPI bus, allowing the FPGA to access the RP2040 SRAM, flash, USB HID controller registers as well as issue commands.*

*The RP2040 firmware also acts as an SPI master and sends updates to the FPGA when the status of the gamepads/joysticks change.*

In addition to the 4 CSPI signals and CLK\_RP there are 6 other signals connected to both the RP2040 and the FPGA: RP\_TX, RP\_RX, and RP\_INT, CDONE, CRESET and BTN.

The firmware can be updated by holding down the BOOTSEL button, connecting the USB-C port to your computer, and then dragging and dropping a new UF2 file to the device filesystem.

## DDMI

See this [my_hdmi_device fork](https://github.com/machdyne/my_hdmi_device) for an example of outputting video on the DDMI port.

See this [SmolDVI fork](https://github.com/machdyne/SmolDVI) for another example of outputting video on the DDMI port.
